# 09_shades_generator

This stub is a component that can be used to generate shades from a single color input. It generates 10 tints (the color mixed with white) and 10 shades (the color mixed with black) each of a varying proportion of white or black mixed in. The component also displays a random color on load to show the user how they can expect the output to be once they enter a color of their own choice.

## Attributions

This component uses a github project called [values.js](https://github.com/noeldelgado/values.js) by [Noel delgado](https://github.com/noeldelgado) to generate the shades of the chosen color.
